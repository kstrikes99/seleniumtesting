    <h2>Testing Activities</h2>
    <p>
        Testing is an essential part of the software development lifecycle. It involves evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets the specified requirements and works as expected. Testing can be broadly classified into manual testing and automated testing. Manual testing requires a human to interact with the software and evaluate its various aspects, while automated testing uses tools and scripts to perform tests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Functional testing is a type of testing that validates the software system against the functional requirements/specifications. The purpose of functional tests is to check the user interface, APIs, databases, security, client/server applications, and functionality of the software under test. Functional testing can be performed manually or with automation.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several types of functional testing, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Unit testing involves testing individual components of the software. Integration testing checks the interaction between integrated units/modules. System testing evaluates the complete and integrated software system to ensure compliance with requirements. Acceptance testing is conducted to determine whether the system meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.
